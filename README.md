## Overview

LaundrEase is a U.S.-based laundry pickup and delivery startup, founded in 2020, with a mission to serve underserved small and mid-sized cities across the country. Unlike larger competitors that concentrate on major urban centers, LaundrEase has built its strategy around localized service, convenience, and affordability in areas with limited competition.

This analysis was developed in close coordination with the Director of Growth & Operations, who is leading efforts to uncover data-driven insights that can guide strategic decisions around sales, marketing, and geographic expansion. The primary objective is to optimize regional investments and identify high-potential cities for targeted growth.

## Business Context & Objectives

LaundrEase currently operates in 140 established cities and has recently expanded into **10 new cities**. The company is structured into **two sales regions**, and the Director of Growth & Operations is seeking clear, data-backed recommendations to:

1. **Evaluate Regional Performance**:
   Determine which of the two sales regions is performing better using three key metrics:
- Average Revenue per City
- Average Marketing Spend per City
- Average ROMI per City (ROMI - Return on Marketing Investment)

2. **Assess New City Potential**:
   Among the 10 new cities, identify which ones demonstrate the best potential for increased marketing investment.

## Key Metrics Defined

- **Average Revenue per City**: Total revenue / Number of cities in the region  
- **Average Marketing Spend per City**: Total spend / Number of cities (lower = better)  
- **ROMI**: Revenue / Marketing Spend (higher = better)  

## Insights and Recommendations

### Regional Performance:
- The analysis revealed that **Region 1** outperformed the other across **all 3** critical metrics.
